# Intune Commander - .NET Remake

![Intune Logo](docs/images/logo_small.png)

Intune Commander is a cross-platform desktop application for managing Microsoft Intune configurations across Commercial, GCC, GCC-High, and DoD cloud environments. Built with .NET 10 and Avalonia UI, it reimagines the PowerShell-based IntuneManagement tool as a compiled, async-first application that eliminates the UI freezes, threading deadlocks, and data refresh issues common in PowerShell WPF tools.

It supports multi-cloud and multi-tenant profiles with encrypted local storage, manages over 30 Intune object types (device configurations, compliance policies, conditional access policies, applications, and more), and provides bulk export/import in a JSON format compatible with the original PowerShell tool. Additional features include Conditional Access PowerPoint export, LiveCharts dashboards, debug logging, and raw JSON inspection.

> **Platform Notes**
>
> - **Windows** is the recommended and fully supported platform.
> - **macOS** has significant Avalonia limitations that currently require Device Code authentication instead of an interactive browser popup.
> - **Linux** support is planned but will initially be limited to headless/Core scenarios, with scheduled report generation as the primary target use case.

## Project Overview

### Goals

- **Multi-cloud support:** Commercial, GCC, GCC-High, DoD tenants
- **Multi-tenant:** Easy switching between tenant environments with profile management
- **Native performance:** Compiled .NET code eliminates PowerShell threading issues
- **Cross-platform:** Linux and macOS support via Avalonia (planned)
- **Backward compatible:** Import/export compatible with PowerShell version JSON format

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Runtime | .NET 10, C# 12 |
| UI Framework | Avalonia 11.3.x (`.axaml` files, FluentTheme) |
| MVVM | CommunityToolkit.Mvvm 8.2.x |
| Authentication | Azure.Identity 1.17.x |
| Graph API | **Microsoft.Graph.Beta** 5.130.x-preview |
| Cache | LiteDB 5.0.x (AES-encrypted via DataProtection) |
| Charts | LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharpView.Avalonia |
| PowerPoint Export | Syncfusion.Presentation.Net.Core 28.1.x |
| DI | Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection 10.0.x |
| Testing | xUnit |

> **Note:** This project uses `Microsoft.Graph.Beta`, **not** the stable `Microsoft.Graph` package. All models and `GraphServiceClient` come from `Microsoft.Graph.Beta.*`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code with C# Dev Kit
- An Azure AD app registration with appropriate Microsoft Graph permissions (for use with the beta Microsoft Graph SDK/endpoint)
- (Optional) Syncfusion license key for PowerPoint export feature - see [Syncfusion Licensing](#syncfusion-licensing)
- (Optional) Avalonia Accelerate community license.

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build all projects
dotnet build

# Run unit tests
dotnet test

# Run a single test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ProfileServiceTests"

# Run the desktop application
dotnet run --project src/Intune.Commander.Desktop
```

### Profile Management

Intune Commander stores connection details as **profiles** (tenant ID, client ID, cloud, auth method). Profiles are persisted locally in an encrypted file and never leave your machine.

**Manually adding a profile:**

1. Launch the app — you'll land on the login screen
2. Fill in Tenant ID, Client ID, Cloud, and (optionally) Client Secret
3. Click **Save Profile** to persist it for future sessions

**Importing profiles from a JSON file:**

1. Click **Import Profiles** on the login screen
2. Select a `.json` file containing one or more profile definitions
3. Profiles are merged in — duplicates (same Tenant ID + Client ID) are skipped automatically
4. The imported profiles appear immediately in the **Saved Profiles** dropdown

A ready-to-use template is available at [`.github/profile-template.json`](.github/profile-template.json). Download it, fill in your real Tenant IDs and Client IDs, and import it directly.

**Supported JSON shapes:**

```json
// Array of profiles (recommended)
[
  {
    "name": "Contoso-Prod",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "clientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "cloud": "Commercial",
    "authMethod": "Interactive"
  }
]
```

Valid `cloud` values: `Commercial`, `GCC`, `GCCHigh`, `DoD`
Valid `authMethod` values: `Interactive` (browser popup), `ClientSecret` (include `"clientSecret"` field)

### App Registration Setup

1. Go to **Azure Portal → Entra ID → App Registrations → New registration**
2. Name your app (e.g. `IntuneCommander-Dev`)
3. Set **Redirect URI** to `http://localhost:45132` (Mobile and desktop applications)
4. Under **API permissions**, add `Microsoft Graph → Delegated → DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` and related Intune scopes
5. Grant admin consent for the tenant

For **Government clouds** (GCC-High, DoD), register separate apps in the respective Azure portals (`portal.azure.us`, `portal.apps.mil`).

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interactive** (default) | Browser popup with persistent token cache |
| **Client Secret** | Unattended service principal authentication |

## Architecture Summary

```
src/
  Intune.Commander.Core/        # Business logic (.NET 10 class library)
    Auth/                    # Azure.Identity credential providers
    Models/                  # Enums, TenantProfile, ProfileStore, DTOs, CacheEntry
    Services/                # 30+ Graph API services + ProfileService, CacheService, ExportService
    Extensions/              # DI registration (AddIntuneManagerCore)
  Intune.Commander.Desktop/     # Avalonia UI application
    Views/                   # MainWindow, LoginView, OverviewView, DebugLogWindow, RawJsonWindow
    ViewModels/              # MainWindowViewModel, LoginViewModel, OverviewViewModel
    Services/                # DebugLogService (in-memory log, UI-thread-safe)
    Converters/              # ComputedColumnConverters
tests/
  Intune.Commander.Core.Tests/  # xUnit tests (200+ cases)
```

Graph API services are created **after** authentication (`new XxxService(graphClient)`) — they are not registered in DI at startup.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full architectural decisions.

## Features

### Conditional Access PowerPoint Export

Export Conditional Access policies to a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation with:

- Cover slide with tenant name and export timestamp
- Tenant summary with policy counts
- Policy inventory table showing all policies
- Detailed slides for each policy (conditions, grant controls, assignments)

**Usage:**

1. Navigate to the Conditional Access category
2. Load CA policies
3. Click "📊 Export PowerPoint" button
4. Choose save location
5. Open the generated `.pptx` file

**Current Limitations (v1):**

- Commercial cloud only (GCC/GCC-High/DoD support planned for future release)
- Basic policy details (advanced dependency lookups deferred)
- Feature-level parity with idPowerToys CA decks (not pixel-perfect template matching)

### Syncfusion Licensing

The PowerPoint export feature uses Syncfusion.Presentation.Net.Core, which requires a license key.

**End users of the official `.exe` release do not need a key** — it is baked into the binary at build time.

**Community License (FREE):**

- For companies/individuals with < $1M annual revenue
- Maximum 5 developers
- Register at: <https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/communitylicense>

**Commercial License:**

- Required for companies exceeding Community License thresholds
- Visit: <https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/products>

**Setup for local development or self-builds:**
Set environment variable: `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here`

The app will run without a license key but will display watermarks on exported PowerPoint files.

**How the released binary gets the key:**
The tag-triggered `codesign.yml` workflow reads the `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` secret from the `codesigning` environment and passes it as `-p:SyncfusionLicenseKey=...` during `dotnet publish`. It is baked into the binary as assembly metadata before Azure Trusted Signing runs. The key never appears in source code or git history. Store it in your secret manager (e.g. 1Password) and add it as a secret in the `codesigning` GitHub Actions environment named `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY`.
