# Graph API Permissions — Intune Commander Integration Tests

This document tracks every Microsoft Graph permission required by the Intune Commander app registration,
mapped to the services and endpoints that need them.

## Application Permissions (Required)

All permissions below are **Application** type (not Delegated) and require **admin consent**.

### Intune — Device Management

| Permission | Access | Services |
|---|---|---|
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | ConfigurationProfile, Compliance, AdministrativeTemplate, EndpointSecurity, SettingsCatalog, FeatureUpdate, AssignmentFilter, QualityUpdateProfile, DriverUpdateProfile, ComplianceScript, AdmxFile |
| `DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | DeviceHealthScript, MacCustomAttribute, DeviceShellScript |
| `DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | Application, AppProtectionPolicy, ManagedAppConfiguration, PolicySet |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | EnrollmentConfiguration, Autopilot, IntuneBranding, TermsAndConditions, AppleDep |
| `DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | RoleDefinition, ScopeTag |
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` | Read | Device queries (future), DeviceCategory |

### Windows 365 — Cloud PC

| Permission | Access | Services |
|---|---|---|
| `CloudPC.ReadWrite.All` | Read & write | CloudPcProvisioningService, CloudPcUserSettingsService |

> **Note:** Cloud PC permissions require the tenant to have an active Windows 365 licence. Without a licence the endpoints return HTTP 403 regardless of app permissions.

## Notes

- All endpoints use the **Beta** Graph API (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/`)
- The app uses `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` scope, which grants whatever permissions are consented on the registration
- For **GCC/GCC-High/DoD** clouds, the authority and Graph base URL differ — see `CloudEndpoints.GetEndpoints()`
- `ReadWrite` permissions are supersets that include read access, so we don't need separate `Read.All` for services that also write
- `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` covers `Policy.Read.All` for conditional access resources
