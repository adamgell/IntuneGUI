## Notes

- All endpoints use the **Beta** Graph API (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/`)
- The app uses `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` scope, which grants whatever permissions are consented on the registration
- For **GCC/GCC-High/DoD** clouds, the authority and Graph base URL differ — see `CloudEndpoints.GetEndpoints()`
- `ReadWrite` permissions are supersets that include read access, so we don't need separate `Read.All` for services that also write
- `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` covers `Policy.Read.All` for conditional access resources
