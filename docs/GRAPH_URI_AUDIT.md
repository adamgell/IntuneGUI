# Graph URI Audit and Service Build-Out Plan

This document inventories Graph API URI usage from the `IntuneManagement` submodule and maps it to the current Intune Commander service/view architecture.

## Artifacts

- Raw endpoint inventory (generated): `docs/graph-uri-inventory.csv`
- Source scanned: `IntuneManagement/**/*.ps1`, `IntuneManagement/**/*.psm1`
- Extraction captured:
  - `Invoke-GraphRequest -Url "..."` calls
  - `API = "..."` object type definitions

## Summary

- Extracted URI rows: **132**
- Unique URI patterns: **104**
- Stable/non-templated URI patterns: **63**
- **Implemented in Intune Commander: 26 direct Graph API services** (Waves 1–5 complete)
- **Additional completed feature:** `IConditionalAccessPptExportService` (Wave 6) — orchestrates CA policy data from existing services into a PowerPoint export; not a direct Graph API service

## Suggested Build Sequence (next waves)

Per [SERVICE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](SERVICE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md):

1. **Wave 7 — Scripts** (highest migration value): `IDeviceManagementScriptService`, `IDeviceShellScriptService`, `IComplianceScriptService`, `IAdmxFileService`, `IReusablePolicySettingService`
2. **Wave 8 — Update Plane**: Quality Updates, Driver Update Profiles
3. **Wave 9 — Enrollment + Apple**: DEP onboarding, device categories
4. **Wave 10 — Cloud PC + Long-Tail**: W365 provisioning/user settings, VPP tokens

## Service Implementation Standard

For each new service:

- Define `I{Type}Service` in `src/Intune.Commander.Core/Services/`.
- Implement `{Type}Service` with `GraphServiceClient` constructor injection.
- Use manual `@odata.nextLink` pagination (`$top=999` on initial request, then `.WithUrl(nextLink)`).
- Accept `CancellationToken` in all async methods.
- Return Graph SDK models directly (`Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Models`).
- Add export/import support for all migration-relevant types.
- Add focused Core tests: pagination, CRUD/null handling, serialization.

## Notes

- Inventory includes templated URIs with PowerShell variables (e.g. `/$($objectType.API)/...`); these indicate dynamic object handling in the legacy tool.
- All endpoints use the **Beta** Graph API (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/`).
- The current architecture is service-per-type; new services must follow the same pattern.
- `$top=999` is the correct pagination default (not `$top=200` as the CSV audit originally noted).
- `IConditionalAccessPptExportService` is **not** counted in the 26 direct Graph API services — it is an export orchestrator that reads data already loaded into the ViewModel rather than making its own Graph calls.
