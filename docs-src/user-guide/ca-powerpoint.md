# Conditional Access PowerPoint Export

Intune Commander can export all your Conditional Access policies to a fully-formatted PowerPoint presentation — ideal for audits, compliance reviews, and architecture documentation.

!!! warning "Not yet available in the desktop UI"
    The CA PowerPoint export service is built and tested in the Core library, but the Conditional Access workspace has not been ported to the React desktop UI yet. This feature will be accessible once the Conditional Access workspace is added.

## What's in the deck

The generated presentation includes:

- **Cover slide** — tenant name and export timestamp
- **Tenant summary** — total policy counts by state (enabled / disabled / report-only)
- **Policy inventory table** — all policies at a glance
- **Per-policy detail slides** — for each policy:
  - Conditions (users, cloud apps, device platforms, locations, risk levels)
  - Grant controls (MFA, compliant device, etc.)
  - Session controls
  - Assignment scope

## Syncfusion licence

The PowerPoint export feature uses [Syncfusion.Presentation.Net.Core](https://www.syncfusion.com/powerpoint-framework/net). A licence key is required to remove watermarks from exported files.

End users of the **official signed `.exe` release** do not need to do anything — the key is baked into the binary at build time.

### Community Licence (free)

Syncfusion offers a free community licence for:

- Individuals or companies with **less than $1M annual revenue**, **and**
- **5 or fewer developers**

### Setting your licence key (development / self-build)

Set the environment variable before launching the app:

```
SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY=your-key-here
```

The app works without a key but will display a watermark on exported slides.

### How the released `.exe` has the key embedded

The tag-triggered `codesign.yml` workflow reads `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` from the `codesigning` GitHub Actions environment and passes it as an MSBuild property during `dotnet publish`:

```
-p:SyncfusionLicenseKey="$env:SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY"
```

This bakes the key into the binary as assembly metadata **before** Azure Trusted Signing runs, so the signed `.exe` carries the key. No environment variable is required at runtime — your end users get watermark-free exports automatically.

!!! info "Why embedding the key in the binary is safe"
    The Syncfusion license key is **not a secret credential**. It is a JWT-style token that the Syncfusion library validates locally and offline against embedded product/version metadata. It does not authenticate to any Syncfusion service at runtime — there is no network call, no account access, and no API key exposure. Embedding it in a distributed binary is the pattern Syncfusion's own documentation explicitly describes (`SyncfusionLicenseProvider.RegisterLicense("YOUR_LICENSE_KEY")`). The `AssemblyMetadata` approach used here is strictly better than hardcoding the value in source because the key never appears in git history.

## Current limitations

- Commercial cloud only — GCC-High/DoD support is planned.
- Basic policy detail rendering — advanced dependency lookups (named locations resolved by name, etc.) are in progress.

!!! tip "idPowerToys compatibility"
    The deck format is inspired by [idPowerToys](https://github.com/merill/idPowerToys) CA report but is generated natively without a web dependency.
